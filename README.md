# Cryptolite
Cryptolite is a Simple File Encryption tool made on python programming language. This is my univerity project.

It is optimized for 1080p res on window scale 100%.

It don't recommend it for personal use as it has some flaws and made by only single person and it uses common library.

To run the code u have to install all the packages mentioned in requirement.txt file.
